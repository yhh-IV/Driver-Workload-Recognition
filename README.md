# Driver-Workload-Recognition

The dataset was created for research on using advanced sensors and vision technologies to infer cognitive loads on drivers. This dataset is available for research purposes, files could be downloaded here after the review process.  
## 1. Experimental Platform
  * EEG headset [(EMOTIVE EPOC Flex)](https://www.emotiv.com/)   
    Ensure good contact quality and EEG quality during the experiments.
